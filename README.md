# ERROR451
# Overview

The Error 451 project strives to bring a web app that will get the user information about the STC bathrooms on campus. It will provide details of the different bathrooms such as baby changing stations, number of stalls, and a rating from students. The purpose is to direct students to either the closest restroom or the best. It will use clickable pop-ups on an STC floor plan to present the user with the specific restroom's details.


# Development Environment

Our team will utilize PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase tools. Firebase will hold the database that has the details of each restroom as well as the rating system. PHP will be mainly used, alongside the other languages, to develop a presentable web app for the user to easily navigate.
