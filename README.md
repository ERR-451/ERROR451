# ERROR451

# Overview

The Error 451 project strives to bring a web app that will get the user information about the STC bathrooms on campus. It will provide details of the different bathrooms such as baby changing stations, number of stalls, and a rating from students. The purpose is to direct students to either the closest restroom or the best.

# Development Environment

Our team will utilize React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase tools. Firebase will hold the database that has the details of each restroom as well as the rating system. React will create the progressive web app. This web app will be user-friendly and reliable.
